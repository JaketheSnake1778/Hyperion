How To install:

1. Install the latest version of Python

How To Play:

Use 'w' to thrust in the prograde direction, 's' to thrust retrograde.
    Prograde means you are thrusting in the direction your ship is heading, Retrograde is the opposite

'a' and 'd' will rotate Hyperion, the current rotation is indicated in the top left by the arrow
    Prograde and Retrograde thrusting will auto-rotate your ship to that direction

Use 'spacebar' to thrust in the direction of your current rotation

!!HYPERION CAN ONLY HANDLE ONE DIRECTIONAL INPUT AT A TIME!!

Use 'p' to pause the game

If an early termination occurs use 'r' to reset

Use alt + f4 to close the game

How To Survive:

Hyperion uses it's fuel over time and to thrust, if it runs out of fuel an early termination will occur
    To acquire more fuel it is necesary to gather it from The Moon using the Orbital LASER

If you collide with an orbiting body an early termination will occur, this includes Asteroids,
    The Moon and Earth

Due to the unfortunate creation and positioning of the SQX84-CI Black Hole, quasars are not uncommon

    You will receive a warning on the HUD, and the initial jet will give you ample time to manuever out of the way

    If you are unfortunate enough to collide with the quasar an early termination will occur
